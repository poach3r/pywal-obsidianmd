# pywal-obsidianmd
A pywal script to create an obsidian.md theme.

## Installation:

`git clone https://github.com/poach3r/pywal-obsidianmd`

`chmod +x ~/pywal-obsidianmd/pywal-obsidianmd.sh`

Then, go to the Obsidian themes section and install the Atom theme.

## Usage:

`~/pywal-obsidianmd/pywal-obsidianmd.sh`

Then simply enter your full vault directory, in my case it would be `/home/poacher/Notes`

You should then see pywal-obsidian as an available theme.
